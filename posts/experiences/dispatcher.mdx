- [Dispatcher](https://dispatcher-pro.com/en) is a cloud-based solution for resources planning on construction sites.

- I had to work on a new [Go backend](https://dispatcher-pro.com/) to improve performance of the previous backend.

- I had to improve the performance of existing APIs, optimize the existing SQL requests and add many new features to the API.

- I also worked on the [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) frontend to improve it and add new features and pages.
