[Dispatcher](https://dispatcher-pro.com/en) is a collaborative, cloud-based solution for resources planning on construction sites.

It's one of the best solution used by big actors in Europe.

I had to work on a new [Go backend](https://dispatcher-pro.com/) that was created to improve performance of the previous
backend. It's a complex backend with access based many permissions for every user. I had to improve the performance of
existing APIs, optimize the existing [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) requests and add many new features to the API.

I also touched the [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) frontend to add some features.
