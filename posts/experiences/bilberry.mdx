- [Bilberry](https://bilberry.io/en) uses AI to reduce the overuse of herbicide.

- I migrated the old infrastructure from single server Docker deployment to [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) on [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/).

- I had to migrate stored objects and databases data and automate the deployment with a CI/CD.

- This led to a better scalability of the infrastructure and more safety for the storage of the data.

- I worked on multiple services based on a [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) / [React](https://reactjs.org/) /
[PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) / [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/).

- I made a 6-month internship and continued to work in freelance.
