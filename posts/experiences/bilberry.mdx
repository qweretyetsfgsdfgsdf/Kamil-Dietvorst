[Bilberry](https://bilberry.io/en) uses AI to reduce the overuse of herbicide.

If you're curious, here is an article written by Nvidia:
[Harvesting AI: Startupâ€™s Weed Recognition for Herbicides Grows Yield for Farmers](https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/2021/04/05/bilberry-weed-recognition-ai-grows-yield-for-farmers/).

I was responsible to migrate the old infrastructure from [Rancher](https://rancher.com/) on [OVH Cloud](https://www.ovh.com/)
to [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) on [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/).

This means that I had to migrate the existing data to the new platform (storage buckets, database)
and automate the deployment with a CI/CD. This led to a better scalability of the infrastructure and more safety for the
storage of the data.

I also had to work on multiple services based on a [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) / [React](https://reactjs.org/) /
[PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) / [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) stack which were actively used by many users.

I made a 6-month internship and continued to work in freelance.
