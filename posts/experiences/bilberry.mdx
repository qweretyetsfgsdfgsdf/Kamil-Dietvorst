- Bilberry uses AI to reduce the overuse of herbicide.

- I migrated the old infrastructure from single server Docker deployment to **Kubernetes** on **Google Cloud**.

- I had to migrate stored objects and databases data and automate the deployment with a CI/CD.

- This led to a better scalability of the infrastructure and more safety for the storage of the data.

- I worked on multiple services based on a **Django** / **React** / **PostgreSQL** / **MongoDB**.

- I made a 6-month internship and continued to work in freelance.
