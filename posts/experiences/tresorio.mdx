- [Tresorio](https://tresorio.com/en) is an eco-friendly cloud provider that reuse 100% of the heat generated by the servers.

- It offers a lot of services including VPS, Storage and Cloud rendering.

- I mainly worked on the Cloud rendering part, it's a [Blender addon](https://tresorio.com/en/cloud-rendering/) that's [open source](https://github.com/Tresorio/pablo).

- I had to work on a [Go](https://golang.org/) backend server that renders [Blender](https://www.blender.org/) scenes.

- I improved the performance, scalability and make it reusable before adding many new features to it.

- I worked on a new [Gitlab](https://about.gitlab.com/) CI/CD pipeline for testing all micro-services.

- I automated deployment for services ([Go](https://golang.org/), [React](https://reactjs.org/), [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/),
[Python](https://www.python.org/)...).
