---

- Tresorio is an eco-friendly cloud provider that reuse 100% of the heat generated by the servers.

- It offers a lot of services including VPS, Storage and Cloud rendering.

- I mainly worked on the Cloud rendering part, it's a Blender addon that's [open source](https://github.com/Tresorio/pablo).

- I had to work on a **Go** backend server that renders **Blender** scenes.

- I improved the performance, scalability and make it reusable before adding many new features to it.

- I worked on a new **Gitlab** CI/CD pipeline for testing all micro-services.

- I automated deployment for services (**Go**, **React**, **Typescript**, **Python**...).
