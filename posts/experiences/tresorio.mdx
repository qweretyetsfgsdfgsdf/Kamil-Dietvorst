[Tresorio](https://tresorio.com/en) is an eco-friendly and affordable cloud provider that reuse 100% of the heat generated by the servers to heat
hot water. For example, it has been used since 2018 to heat a part of the sanitary water of the [Mercy's Hospital in Metz, France](https://tresorio.com/en/blog/tresorio-the-green-alternative-that-meets-the-challenges-of-new-digital-technologies/).

Tresorio offers a lot of services including VPS, Storage and Cloud rendering. I mainly worked on the Cloud rendering part,
it's a [Blender addon](https://tresorio.com/en/cloud-rendering/) that's [open source](https://github.com/Tresorio/pablo).

I had to work on a [Go](https://golang.org/) backend server that is responsible for rendering the [Blender](https://www.blender.org/) scenes submitted
by the users. It has to be scalable, fault tolerant, secure and fast. I restructured all the code to improve the readability,
performance and make it reusable before adding many new features to it.

I also had to work on a new [Gitlab](https://about.gitlab.com/) CI/CD pipeline for testing all our different services and
deploying them ([Go](https://golang.org/), [React](https://reactjs.org/), [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/),
[Python](https://www.python.org/)...).
