Since 2020, I'm working as the CTO of Shareview, a new social network that aims to share breathtaking video landscapes from all over the world.
The team is small, there is one CEO and just one developer.

The challenge is huge: launching a social network from zero. An API, a website, a mobile app for Android and iOS, the encoding of the videos...

I had to make choices on a scalable and efficient infrastructure. I deployed the whole infrastructure on [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/) and all the backend
side while also working on the mobile application. I'm also experimenting hosting some services on [IBM Cloud](https://cloud.ibm.com/).

The infrastructure has been created with [terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) and [ekstcl](https://eksctl.io/).

Shareview backend is composed of multiple services written [Go](https://golang.org/) in that consist of a [GraphQL API](https://graphql.org/) and background services that execute
tasks such as video encoding.

Services use [AWS SQS](https://aws.amazon.com/sqs/) to communicate between each other and are
deployed with [Helm charts](https://helm.sh/) on [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) on auto-scaled
[AWS EKS](https://aws.amazon.com/eks/) cluster.

For monitoring we use [Sentry](https://sentry.io/welcome/) and the EFK stack ([ElasticSearch](https://www.elastic.co/elasticsearch/),
[Fluentd](https://www.fluentd.org/architecture) and [Kibana](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/kibana/current/introduction.html)).

The mobile application is made in [react-native](https://reactnative.dev/) with [expo](https://expo.io/) in
[bare workflow](https://docs.expo.io/introduction/managed-vs-bare/#bare-workflow). Website is made with [next.js](https://nextjs.org/).
