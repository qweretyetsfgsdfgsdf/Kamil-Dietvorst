- CTO of Shareview, a new social network that aims to share landscapes from all over the world.

- I designed the whole infrastructure on [AWS EKS](https://aws.amazon.com/eks/), Backend services and worked on the mobile application.

- The infrastructure is fully managed with [terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) and [ekstcl](https://eksctl.io/).

- Backend services are written in [Go](https://golang.org/) and expose a [GraphQL API](https://graphql.org/).

- Backend services communicates with a pub/sub queue, for tasks such as video encoding.

- Deployment is automated with a CI/CD and [Helm charts](https://helm.sh/).

- Monitoring is made with [Sentry](https://sentry.io/) and EFK stack ([ElasticSearch](https://www.elastic.co/elasticsearch/),
[Fluentd](https://www.fluentd.org/architecture) and [Kibana](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/kibana/current/introduction.html)).
